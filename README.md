# MealMatch: Personalized Nutrition Solution

## Project Overview:
MealMatch is an innovative mobile application that provides customized meal plans tailored to individual fitness goals, such as fat loss, muscle gain, bulking, and body recomposition. This app combines nutrition science with convenient meal delivery, helping users stay consistent with their dietary plans and track their progress for enhanced health outcomes.

## About

MealMatch addresses the challenge of achieving fitness goals through nutrition by offering a seamless way to follow tailored meal plans. Traditional meal planning can be time-consuming and inflexible, often lacking the customization and regular adjustments needed to align with changing goals. MealMatch overcomes these limitations by using a personalized approach that analyzes user dietary needs and preferences, integrating feedback to adjust meal plans for optimal results. With the appâ€™s intuitive design and progress-tracking features, users gain easy access to quality nutrition that aligns with their health objectives.

## Features

- Personalized Meal Plans: Crafted to support specific goals like fat loss, muscle gain, and recomposition.
- Real-Time Monitoring and Adjustments: Tracks user progress and customizes meal plans based on feedback.
- Convenient Mobile Interface: Allows users to browse meals, schedule deliveries, and contact support seamlessly.
- Fresh, Macro-Balanced Meals: Meals are made from quality ingredients, balanced in protein, carbs, and fats for comprehensive nutrition.
- Flexible Subscription Options: Options for daily, weekly, or customizable delivery schedules to suit user lifestyles.
